# Main description
This is a repository so i can enhance my python, english and git/github skills. Here you can find scripts that can help in automation regarding files and organization, CLI tools and related kind of utilities. You can also find here utilities based on object oriented programming.

## Automation folder
The automation folder contains python utilities, varying from very simplistic applications, to advanced, actually useful and applicable on real life companies and situations. This folder focuses on organizing folders, renaming them and even gets on csv automation.

## Excel automation folder
This folder is similar to the automation folder, though instead of focusing on general automation and organization, it focuses specifically on excel automation (The utilities do things such as automatically creating filtered reports).

## Object oriented programming folder
On this folder, i have complex projects and examples about object oriented programming, i even made a virtual pet simulator game (similar to tamagotchi and talking tom). Here is what i consider to be the biggest advancing i did on programming, since OOP is used to make very complex systems and applications.
